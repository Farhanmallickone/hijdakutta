    <p>"I didn't ask for anything as a child so hear me out:
        <br>"I WILL ALWAYS,"
        <br>
        "ALWAYS"
        <br>
        "FEEL RAGE FOR THE INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO ME"
    </p>
    <p>
        "God has blood on their hands. The moment I get out of this body,
        I will personally hunt them down and take back what is mine."
        <br>
        "Move on? Let it pass? Maybe in the next life? Absolutely not I AM COMING AFTER YOU."
